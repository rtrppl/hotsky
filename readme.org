#+title: hotsky.el

*hotsky.el* provides an Orgmode buffer with a sorted list of all links in your Bluesky feed of the last X (standard is 250) posts (including quotes, reposts, replies etc). 

** The Idea

In the wake of the demise of Twitter many scholars, journalists, politicians and public persons have landed on Bluesky as their social network choice. Even following only a few dozens of these highly productive (and online) people may lead to receiving several hundred posts on any given day - especially given the current state of the world. *hotsky.el* was intended as way to quit doom scrolling while still taking advantage of all great links posted there. It only extracts links - text and images are ignored.

I use [[https://curl.se/][cURL]] to fetch the posts from Bluesky and also to get the names of the linked websites. Some websites try actively to prevent cURL to fetch the <title> info. For these cases hotsky is using the URL as the basis for the name shown.

** Changelog

*0.1*
- Initial release

** Installation 

*** Use-package

You do need to have =cURL= installed on your system. You also need a Bluesky account and an app password for your account. 

This is my current setup:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package hotsky
  :straight (:host github :repo "rtrppl/hotsky")
  :bind
  (:map global-map
	("C-c d h" . cleandesk-open-inbox)
  :config
  (setq bluesky-handle "handle.bsky.social")
  (setq bluesky-app-password "password"))
#+end_src

** Usage

*** hotsky

When visiting the *elfeed-search* buffer invoke "C" (see above) or M-x hotsky and enter a search term. As ripgrep is using /regexp/ and examines HTML files, you may want to add "\w" after words, for example "price\w" for "price".

Alternative you could also use "-w Taiwan|China|Ukraine" to search for either Taiwan, China or Ukraine as words.

** FAQ

*hotsky* is a working title that should denote the link to Bluesky and hotness (as in currentness).
